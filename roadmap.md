## Gold Cryptocurrency Roadmap

The whole roadmap will be hard to achieve without our premined coins.

**Premine distribution**:
1. 1,570,370 (2.6%) = Initial Coin Offering (ICO) (target: 14 BTC, funds will be used to pay exchanges, servers, dedicated nodes, maintenance, etc.)
2. 38,947,222.5 (65%) = **decentralized funds** to reward community's projects, not the core dev's projects
3. 7,789,444.5 (13%) = marketing (e.g. advertising, press releases, growth hacks, etc.)
4. 5,192,963 (8.6%) = funds for core devs to create the main projects
3. 500,000 (0.8%) = bounties, airdrops and rewards
4. 6,000,000 (10%) = for creators/developers (the only premine for core devs)
